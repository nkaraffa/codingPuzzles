# codingPuzzles

Each Sunday, I'll upload a new code file, titled Week X. If you would like to participate, initiate a pull request with your solution to the puzzle.

Good luck, and happy coding!

## How do I create a pull request?
1. When looking at the file, click the pencil icon to edit it.
2. Input your code into the box.
3. At the bottom, click "Propose changes". This will create a pull request, which can be reviewed by the owner of the repository.

## I can't figure it out. Where can I turn?
That's okay! Most of these puzzles are designed to be _hard_ for those of us who are new to programming. If you can solve it in five minutes, great! But a real puzzle should be a challenge.

I'd suggest a few resources:
- Google your problem. This should always be the first thing to do when you've exhausted your knowledge.
- Reach out on Discord! Everyone gets stuck somewhere. Asking for help is a sign that you're trying to learn. 

## I solved it, but I don't think it's good code.
That's great! Solving the problem is the first and most important step. But to determine if it's good code, look at a couple things:
- Is there a quicker, simpler way to solve this problem?
- Is my code readable?
- Do I have a lot of redundant work?
